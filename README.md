Secure messaging can involve a lot of elements, so we have chosen the most important factors to qualify an application to be a secure messaging app. End-to-end encryption, multi-mode messaging, and synchronization among different platforms/devices are the three main keys to look for when deciding on the best messaging program to use.

End-to-end encryption is a way of creating secure messaging apps by encrypting information so that only the players engaged in communication can read the messages, excluding Internet service providers, the app maker, the government or anyone else. From the moment a message is typed, to the time it spends in transit, to the second itâ€™s received, no one else can see that message. Currently, this method is the safest, most private method of messaging. If an app is not end-to-end encrypted, deem it non-private. The message only decrypts using a locally stored key or secret code when it passes from the sender to the receiver, ensuring direct secure messaging. Encryption does not allow copies of messages to be stored anywhere, including on servers.
